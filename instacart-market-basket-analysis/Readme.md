# Instacart-market-basket-analysis



### Abstract

This project is trying to predict what users may want to buy based on there previous shopping behavior. Full description of the project can be found on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis).



### How to run code

Environment:

Windows 10 64-bit platform(which I think is not important)

python 3.7.7

numpy 1.18.5

pandas 1.0.5

lightgbm 2.3.0

xgboost 0.90

32GB memory ( but trust me it won't cost so much ) and i9-9900K ( I believe i7-4790 works too)



After properly put the dataset into the right position

run python3 preprossing.py

run python3 lightgbm_.py



### Data analysis

See data_analysis.ipynb file.


### Data preprocessing



### Train on lightGBM



### Future work
